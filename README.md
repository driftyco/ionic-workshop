For everything else, the cordova docs are the best source of infomation

[Cordova setup guide](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.0.0/guide_platforms_index.md.html#Platform%20Guides)

With all the SDKs setup, you need to install ionic, cordova, gulp, and bower.


```bash
#windows
$ npm install -g ionic cordova gulp bower

# osx and linux
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova gulp bower
```

When that is complete, lets git clone this project and cd into it.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-workshop.git

$ cd ionic-workshop
```

From there, were can cd into the various directories, and run `ionic serve`
